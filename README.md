### Description of project

This is my latest project that I have built as a test project to test user accounts, working with REST and testing out Chakra UI to see if the combination will be suitable for a commercial grade website.

I am a member for a local community car club which has 3 electric cars, I have offered to create a booking system for them and will be using this project as a starter template.

For me, this project has been very enjoyable and has taught me about bringing React and Node.js together to build a Full Stack Application in a much more easier method that before using frameworks such as Laravel or Wordpress. It will also mean I can quickly develop a full system for the car club.

Once I get this project finished within the next week, I will then copy and start on the car club site using the same techniques.

## Stack used
